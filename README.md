# HW-Hangman_Game

##Requirements: 
1. Use key eventes to listen for the letters that players will type. 
2. Display the following on the page: 
    -Press any key to get started! 
    -Wins (# of times user guessed the word correctly)
    -Number of Guesses Remaining 
    -Letters Already Guessed 
3. Alert user if he/she wins/loses. 
    
##Technologies Used: 
-HTML 
-Bootstrap
-Javascript 

##Code Explanation: 
* Designed the page using Bootstrap in HTML.  
* Javascript 
    * I created a function to make sure that the number of guesses remaining will not go down if the same letter is pressed by the player. 
    * By separating each of the functions I needed for the game, it helped me keep organized, and debug easily.
